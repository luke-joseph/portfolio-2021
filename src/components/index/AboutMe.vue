      <p class="mt-4">
        Born and raised in the UK, I have always had a great love for music, computers and technology. Berlin naturally attracted me due to being equal parts creativity and technology.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-4">
        Professionally I use cutting edge technology to provide solutions & create frictionless experiences. I enjoy working in Berlin with many different types of businesses and bringing ideas to digital fruition.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-4">
        When Iâ€™m not coding you will most likely find me creating music & dj sets, playing valorant, watching movies, exercising or reading.
